Servings: 6 to 8 servings
Prep Time: 2 hours
Cook Time: 2 hours
Ingredients:
    2 pounds pig trotters
    2 pounds chicken backs and carcasses, skin and excess fat removed
    1 large onion
    12 garlic cloves
    One 3-inch knob ginger
    2 whole leeks
    2 dozen scallions, white parts only (reserve greens and light green parts for garnishing finished soup)
    6 ounces whole mushrooms or mushroom scraps, such as cremini
    Black peppercorns
    Bay Leaves
    lemon juice to taste
    Salt to taste (roughly 1 tbsp per gallon of stock. it should be slightly under-salted so that you can season your final dish to taste)


Intructions:
1. For a smokey broth, char the onions and ginger in oil in the stock pot before adding anything else. remove from stock pot for step 2.
2. add chicken feet and pigs trotters to a stock pot and cover with water. bring to a rolling boil for 20 minutes. Much of the impurities and gunk from the bones should have detached and will be floating around in the broth. carefully strain the bones and rinse to remove any additional grey gunk. 
3. Liberally salt the bones and add back to the stockpot. gentle simmer for 6-8 hours until all of the connective tissue has dissolved.  Note: I often use a pressure cooker to cook the bones seperately from the main stock because I don't have enough room in my instant pot for the bones and the veggies. This reduces the overall cook time for the bones to 2 hours. Then I add the bone stock back into the main stock when they are done.
4. Add the cleaned and prepared veggies to the stockpot. bring to a gentle simmer for 2 hours.
5. If you cooked the bones seperately, add the bone broth and veggie stock together and salt and lemon juice to taste.
