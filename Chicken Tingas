Boil chicken (we used legs and thighs, but I think anything would work) with one onion cut in half, some garlic, and a bay leaf. 

Meanwhile, roast two jalapenos, one or two manzano chiles, four tomatoes and another onion cut in half. Roast until dark. 

Saute about a handful of whole coriander seed, three fingers of fennel seed, oregano, and marjoram (?) Until aromatic. Add tomato, peppers, onion, and garlic from chicken. This is also when we would shred the chicken usually. 

Blend veggies until very smooth. Pour over cooked shredded chicken and let simmer together. 

This makes enough to feed like, 20 people. You probably need to reduce a bit. The manzanois spicy but will add to the tang. I also know that in Mexican food sometimes that tang is from caramelized onions, so you could slice and caramelize instead of blending
We ate with radish, lettuce, and cotija
This was also so spicy that literally all of us cried. Every time. You could modify for less emotions
